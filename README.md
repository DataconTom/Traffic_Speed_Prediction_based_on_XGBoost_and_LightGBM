# Traffic Speed Prediction (XGBoost and LightGBM)
## Description
The dataset provides the average traffic speed per hour for a major road in Hong Kong from 2017 to 2018. Part of the dataset is provided as the training data, and your task is to predict the rest. 80% of the dataset is provided as the training data and 20% as the testing data, including the timestamp and the corresponding average speed. We sampled the testing data only from the year 2018 to provide you a training dataset that has the complete data spanning the year 2017. However, the speed information is sometimes missing due to device malfunction.
Evaluation Metric:the mean-squared error
## Prediction Model
In this project, I used XGBoost regression model and LightGBM regression model to do prediction about the traffic speed.
